					Why is designing social technologies so hard? While code and databases can be rigid and brittle, as social actors, we have nuanced social
					requirements and perform actions circumstantially. There is an inherent gap here that may be unbridgeable. 
					But trying to just directly replicate in-person interaction also misses out on new possibilities with technology.
					Instead, in building a constructed world, what we are creating are <i>new</i> interactions---these are different from offline social 
					requirements but equally rich.

				<b>Crossing distances</b><BR>
					Though technology enables collaboration across distances, it is still difficult, as we have experienced to some degree in this pandemic
					year of collaborating remotely.
					There are also different kinds of distances---it can mean distance across space and time-zones, across time (synchronous vs asynchronous),
					and across cultures and contexts. 
					Can design of social systems account for these distances or mitigate the struggles of working across them?

					<b>Authenticity, vulnerability, and identity</b><BR>
						An important aspect of social computing system design is designing capabilities for identity expression and management.
					In time, we've gone from visions of a "identity-less utopia" in the days of the early internet to more recently, 
					Facebook's "Real Name" policy.
					So should systems enforce any aspect of identity? 
					What meta-data can an individual associate with an
					account, what aspects are salient in presentation to different audiences, and how expressive, flexible, and controllable is that presentation?
					How much can we be authentically and fluidly ourselves given certain technical designs?

					<b>Collective and civic action</b><BR>
						Despite threats to democracy posed by social technologies, these spaces can also be an exciting

						grassroots political movements to grow that push for cultural and political change and also involve more people in the 
						process of governing by inviting greater public input and deliberation.
						Many social technologies used for these purposes weren't built with them in mind. Could they better support these goals?

						Participation
					</b><BR>
						All these opportunities for greater participation enabled by social technologies in principle help to shift the power 
						balance from implementors, governors, and designers towards the people who are actually affected by the decisions that people in power make.
						However in practice, sometimes "participation-washing" can be extractive and disempowering. Other times, a great deal of participation
						results in no outcome. How can design of social technologies support not just the elicitation of opinions and dialogue but also the
						converging of a group of people towards consensus, solution, or action?
